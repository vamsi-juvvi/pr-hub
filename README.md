# pr-hub

Collection of docs related to PRs in other repos. I tend to include PR related docs in the same repo so that searches will being up design thoughts, design rejection reasons and such. However, when sending a PR for other repos, I can't required them to also take in a directory with design docs and possibly images. 

Those docs from a subsequently-deleted fork branch end up here.
